# minesweeper
The GitHub repository for my personal project rendition of the classic game, Minesweeper.

To play, compile the .java files, and run the class compiled from the src/main/MinesweeperMain.java file. This will open the main Minesweeper game screen. Left-click to reveal what is underneath a tile, and right-click to mark a tile as a bomb tile. When an end state is reached (i.e., the player has won/lost), the game will automatically reset.

All the code used was authored by Raul Hernandez in 2022 using Eclipse IDE.
